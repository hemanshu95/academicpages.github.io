I am Hemanshu Sondhi, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India. I am highy passionate about working with new technology.
As a part of my Bachelor Thesis supervised by Dr. Hari Prabhat Gupta, IIT(BHU) Varanasi, I am working in the field of Software Defined Network(SDN).

I also had been working with a couple of startups during my other internships.
